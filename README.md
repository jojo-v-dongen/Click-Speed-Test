# Click-Speed-Test
Simple Tkinter program to measure your CPS. measured in 5, 10, 30 and 60 seconds.


## Disclaimer
This is not a well-coded project, tkinter should always be in a class for example and I am sure I messed some other things up!
This was one of my first projects as a beginner (which I still am) so please don't take this code seriously.
